im too lazy to implement this, cause if you're interested enough to want to change variant&whatever strings, then you'll probably have found yourself here anyway

basically any block that says "mmr3Hash" derives a string from a Murmur3 Hash

in most cases you can look through another tag to find the hash you're after
eg. the possible valid hashes for "default variant" can be found in that objects' hlmt, under variants (its the first block in that tagblock)

but since you're here, these are some hashes that i did map, 
_ at the start denotes that i guessed it,
no underscore means that is the original string (or one of) derived from the hash

if you're still interested i have dumped millions of strings from every halos, so theres about 50/50 you'd find the hash you're looking for
